## Installation

Install the conda environment. Since installing the environment trough Conda seems to be very slow these days, you can use 
[Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to install the environment.
```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

Install the util scripts if you want to run the notebooks by executing the following command in the root directory:
```
pip install -e .
```
